# EAPCET-Qualification-predictor
This research uses a variety of student-related variables to forecast the qualification status of students in the Andhra Pradesh Engineering, Agriculture, and Pharmacy Common Entrance Test (AP EAPCET). District, state, area, and intermediate marks are among the criteria taken into account for this prediction. We used three distinct machine learning algorithms—Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—to get reliable predictions. The Decision Tree method was proven to produce the best results after analyzing the performance of these models, offering a dependable tool for predicting a student's eligibility status for the AP EAPCET exam.
